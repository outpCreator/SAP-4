Storyteller: In the city on an island, far away…

Storyteller: A plague. Deaths, too many to count. And one Alchemist with an idea.

Storyteller: After her mentor’s sudden, and suspicious, death Lenore was the last Alchemist left in the settlement. 

Storyteller: She was also the last of Ostanes’ legacy, and though her Mentor had done horrible things, she knew he had gotten results. 

Storyteller: Results that could change the tide against this plague wave.
